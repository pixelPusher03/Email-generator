# Mails
 ### MAKE UNLIMITED GMAILS 
  
 - To use this tool you need an valid and working mail account already. </br> 
 - Run the tool enter your working mail address and it asks for number of mail address to generate, type any number say like 10000 hit enter. </br> 
 - It will then generate tons of mails, use those mails for any purpose. </br> 
 - All the messages sent to generated mails, you will receive it on your valid mail which you have entered at the starting. 
 - Also tested with **protonmail, yahoomail** works very well. 
  
 You can generate mails and use it to mass signin a website, it saves output in ".lst" file. Can be used in pentesting of web app or applications. Works well with mostly all the websites while some websites blocks such emails.
